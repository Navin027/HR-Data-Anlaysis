# HR Analytics Dashboard – Power BI
**Project Overview**

This project was created as part of an analytics assignment to evaluate how raw data can be understood, cleaned, and converted into meaningful insights without any predefined business context.
The objective was not to demonstrate data understanding, logical thinking, and clear storytelling rather than just building visuals. Power BI was chosen to design an interactive HR analytics dashboard covering the end-to-end hiring lifecycle.


**Problem Statement**

Given a raw HR hiring dataset with no business rules:
- Understand the data structure
- Identify meaningful metrics
- Build a decision-focused dashboard
- Present insights in a clear and usable way


**Tools Used**

- Power BI – Data modeling, DAX measures, visualization
- Excel – Initial data review and validation
- GitHub – Documentation and project sharing


**Project Approach**

1. **Data Understanding**
   
- Reviewed job, candidate, source, date, and status fields
- Identified core entities such as jobs, candidates, hiring stages, and business units

2. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
   
- Standardized date formats
- Cleaned inconsistent status values
- Handled missing and blank fields
- Maintained logical consistency without making business assumptions

3. **Data Modeling**
   
- Built relationships between job-level and application-level data
- Created a calendar table for time-based analysis
- Designed reusable measures at the model level


**Key Measures Created**

- Total Applications
- Total Jobs Created
- Active Jobs
- Profiles Submitted
- Profiles Selected
- Total Joiners
- Offer-to-Join Conversion %

Offer-to-Join Conversion % is calculated as a ratio and formatted as a percentage for business readability.
